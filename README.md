This is a fairly simple sorting algorithm visualizer, like those you've probabaly seen online.
When starting the project you find a list of the currently implemented algorithms and you just need to click on one to start.
At the momen you need to change the amount of elements and delay in the code itself ( ln. 28  numAmount & ln. 42 delay).
I will also add sound toggle because it is really annoying.

Just start the app through VS Code or any other compatible platform.

Feel free to contribute or give suggestions! 😁
